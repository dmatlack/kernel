/*************
 * IDE: the electrical specification of the cables which connect ATA drives
 * (like hard drives) to another device. Alternatively, an IDE cable can
 * terminate at an IDE card connect to a PCI (Peripheral Component
 * Interconnect).
 * 
 * An IDE can connect up to 4 drives, each of which may be:
 *   - ATA (Serial)       Most hard drives
 *   - ATA (Parallel)     Common among hard drives
 *   - ATAPI (Serial)     Most optical drives
 *   - ATAPI (Parallel)   Common among optical drives
 * 
 * TODO: pick up here after learning about pci
