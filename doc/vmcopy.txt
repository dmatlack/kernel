                  Copying an Address Space

Steps
  1. Shallow copy the kernel mappings.
      HIGH SHALLOW
  2. Shallow copy the read-only mappings.
      LOW SHALLOW
  3. Copy-on-write copy the read-write mappings.
      LOW SHALLOW

Operations
  - HIGH SHALLOW: Only copy page directory entries.
  - LOW SHALLOW:
    1. For each mapping, get the physical page mapped and increment its
    reference counter.
    2. Create page tables, if necessary, and copy page table entries.
    3. For copy-on-write, mark pages as copy-on-write.
